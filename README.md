Small mod that adds various info when you encounter a fleet but before deciding to engage it.

Displays information such as number of ships on each side, DP total, autoresolve strenght (Fleet Power or FP) and the estimated +%EXP bonus due to battle difficulty (using vanilla calcs).

TO DO

- LunaLib support
- Display more detailed stats (default will stay as is or minimal changes, because displaying too much will just lead to clutter but may be useful for modders wishing to see some stats, or well people interested in numbers; because really you dont need to know how much FP is the enemy onslaught adding compared to the kite)
